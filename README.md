# Flood-detection

## Introduction

We provide a method for detecting floods in satellite images, which are processed by fusion of synthetic aperture radar and DEM data, and a good detection is obtained.


## Dataset Information

In this paper, we use the Sen1Floods11 dataset as the training set. Available Open access at:

The data used to detect the image uses data taken by the Sentinel-1 satellite. Available Open access at: https://github.com/sentinel-hub/sentinelhub-py
